This is my portfolio website made with HTML, CSS, js and node.js. The website is responsive and space-themed with a fun mini-game included. It includes a custom language model(Mistral) fine tuned to data about me using RAG integrated from my other project EchoMind to act as an Artifically intelligent "me" in the about section.
